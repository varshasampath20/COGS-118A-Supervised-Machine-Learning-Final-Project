# COGS-118A-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Final-Project
This project focuses on building a apparel specific recommender system based on Amazon reviews. In other words, our goal is to make predictions of clothing categories and recommend it to the customer based on customers' shopping experience with Amazon. We will collect our dataset from Amazon reviews to represent the customers’ shopping experience and preferences for clothing items. Due to the multitude of apparel departments on Amazon, we intend to focus on predicting the top six most reviewed clothing classes. This project will conduct natural language processing using the NLTK library on this dataset to analyze the contents of the reviews and extract the customers’ sentiments about the product. Furthermore, it will use multi-class classification and the One vs. Rest approach with logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, and Random Forest to classify and predict specific categories of women apparel based on various features observed in the reviews dataset. The performance of our model will be evaluated through accuracy scores, confusion matrices, as well as ROC AUC scores. These metrics will give us an overall picture of our classification success and can be used to further modify the model if needed.
